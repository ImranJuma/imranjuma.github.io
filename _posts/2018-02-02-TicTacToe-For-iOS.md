For this project I made a iOS application for a class mate, the student wanted me to make a interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that they could play as well as have a chance at winning. Working on this project was extremely fun as well as gave me a basic insight into more UX development as well as how to make an interactive game for a mobile device. This was an amazing learning experience. I would recommend building this kind of project to any student looking to expand their Swift knowledge and branch out to make something really cool while learning different pattern recognition within iOS libraries!
