This unique project was for a Mobile Application Development course I was taking in Winter 2017. This project consisted of me creating an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game for iOS devices. Working on this project was extremely fun as well as gave me a basic insight into more UX development as well as how to make an interactive game for a mobile device. This was an amazing learning experience. I would recommend building this kind of project to any student looking to expand their Swift knowledge and branch out to make something really cool while learning different pattern recognition within iOS libraries!
