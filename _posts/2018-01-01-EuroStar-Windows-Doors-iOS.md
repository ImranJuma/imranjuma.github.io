For this project I made a iOS application for the client so that way customers can see all the different products they offer as well as have an amazing experience while shopping. From the clinets perspective they wanted all the information from their existing website put inside a mobile application for iOS. The real challange here was to integreate so much information into a single mobile app. Through this application, customers can see the different services offered, email the support team directly for order inquires, as well as see the different products that can be custom made.

And you'll get something that looks like this:
