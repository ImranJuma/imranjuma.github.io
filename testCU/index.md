Welcome to the page all about my CS (Computer Science) Degree BSc Computer Science Honours. Here, at Carleton University's Computer Science Program, I've learnt C++, Java, Java Script, HTML and Much More!

Carleton's CS Program is defiantly one that I would recommend however as always there's tons of independent learning you can do on the side, check out the Boot Camps Page to learn more about those.

This page contains all the course work, final exams, and review's I’ve created, and collected over my time at Carleton. Feel free to brows the collection. As Always, use this content as a study resource to help you excel in your study and please don’t plagiarize my assignments / course work. As always, If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me Here.
